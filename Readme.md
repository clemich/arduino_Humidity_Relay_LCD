Compoment I used for this:

one arduino/fundruino/... nano

2*16 LCD screen with I2C liquidchristal

one 2-relay board for arduino/funduino/...

one potentiometer

one DHT22 with 10K resist in order to use DHT22



Schema will come after but here is the plugged pins:



A1: potentiometer value (other pins of the potentometers are 5V and 0V)

A4:  SCA of the serial I2C

A5: SCL of the serial I2C

D2: data from the DHT22

D8: relay1 - relay needs 0V and 5V as well

D9: relay2 - relay needs 0V and 5V as well
