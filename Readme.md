Compoment I used for this:

one arduino/fundruino/... nano
2*16 LCD screen with I2C liquidchristal
one 2-relay board for arduino/funduino/...
one potentiometer
one DHT22 with 10K resist in order to use DHT22

Schema will come after but here is the plugged pins:

A1: potentiometer value (other pins of the potentometers are 5V and 0V)
A4:  SCA of the serial I2C
A5: SCL of the serial I2C
D2: data from the DHT22
D8: relay1 - relay needs 0V and 5V as well
D9: relay2 - relay needs 0V and 5V as well
